Hi!  I'm your ghostwriter!  Long press the "BOOT" button for more info.
Single click BOOT: Print current line.
Double click BOOT: Select next line.
Triple click BOOT: Load next text file.
Long click BOOT: toggle continuous mode within a text file.
RST: resets me.
Hold down BOOT after releasing RST: USB drive mode - modify my code or edit files in "texts" directory.
Hold down BOOT while releasing RST: UF2 Firmware update mode (don't kill me!).

Would you like to see those options again?  Heck, let me give them to you anyway!
